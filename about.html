At Futel, we believe in the preservation of public telephony as a means of providing access to the agora for everybody, and we are privileged to provide the means of this communication in the form of free domestic telephone calls, voicemail, and telephone-mediated services.  We do not judge the motivations of our users, or who they choose to call; if they don't have someone to call, we can provide a presence on the other end.  Denial of telephony services has long been a tactic used against undesirable populations, and our devices will counteract that.  But more importantly, we can help to establish a new era of communication, one in which reaching out is not only desirable, but mandatory.

To what extent are our interactions mediated by intelligent machines?  Who is doing the talking when we let them decide who we interact with and what constitutes appropriate topics of communication?  We believe that the time has come to greet each other not with our heads down, staring at our hands and begging for the permission of the minds that oversee our networks, but proudly, standing tall, with our eyes open and aware of our surroundings.

<p>
We are primarily driven by the basic needs that we see on the streets every day, by giving something away that is cheap for us but valuable to the recipient.  But we hope that we can also build a tower of Babel on top of that, a monument of telephones and switching networks and cascading psychological structures which will give the community something else as well, something we may not appreciate until it has forever changed us.
